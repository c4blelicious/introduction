# Introduction
A little Introduction about who I am and what I aspire to achieve.

Hello, my Name is Mirac alias @c4blelicious.
I'm currently 19 years of age and I live in Germany.

Learning Python is the first step I chose to take for my upcoming career-change in the future. My goal is to become a skilled and reliable Software-Developer.
Currently I'm doing an apprenticeship as an Industrial Electrician (the fancy word would be "Electronics Technician for Industrial Engineering").
At the end of 2022/2023 I will take my final exams and finish my apprenticeship. Until then I set a goal of learning, coding and studying 6 days of every week, at least one hour Python.

I hope to be able to collaborate with other Software-Developers and people who can help me unfold my potential.

Thank you for reading so far and I hope we can work together on some projects in the future. :)

Best regards,

-Mirac
